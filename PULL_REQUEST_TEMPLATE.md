**Case**
When working with PAM I have this and this expected behavior that I don't think PAM fullfils.

**Proposition**
Here is my proposal for how to solve this.
- Do A
- Do B
- Connect B with A

**Requirements**
This is what I believe is required to make this change good.
- Make sure A works as expected
- B must be modular and easy to edit
- There must be variables to adjust the behavior of both A and B
